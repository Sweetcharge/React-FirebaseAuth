# React-FirebaseAuth
A React application demonstrating Firebase's Authentication API


# React-FirebaseAuth

This React application was created based off of this tutorial (https://www.robinwieruch.de/complete-firebase-authentication-react-tutorial/)
However, I included the Score counter as a way to test what I've learned from this tutorial.

# Features:

- Ability to play a "mini game" and raise their score with a click of a button
- Ability to sign out
- Keep track of the scores of other users
